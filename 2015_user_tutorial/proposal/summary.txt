The course will enable the participants to understand and practically apply the most important
building blocks of machine learning experiments with the mlr package in supervised and
unsupervised machine learning, i.e. classification, regression, survival analysis and clustering.

The mlr package allows data analysts who are neither experts in machine learning nor seasoned R programmers to
specify complex machine learning experiments in short, succinct and scalable code.
Experienced programmers, on the other hand, get to wield a large, well-designed toolbox, which they
can easily customize and extend to their needs.

The participants will learn how to perform basic mlr operations like data
import, data preprocessing, model building, performance evaluation and resampling.
Using these basic building blocks, we will focus on more advanced topics like
benchmarking, model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
We will also demonstrate how to easily parallelize the most time-consuming operations in common parallel environments.
The course will end with a short demonstration on how to access the new OpenML server for open machine
learning (http://www.openml.org) which provides a large repository of benchmark data sets and
enables reproducible experiments and meta analysis.
